# llm-long-term-memory
A simple Python project to give GPT models long-term memory by storing, retrieving, and deleting user-provided facts across conversations


This project implements a memory storage & retrieval system that gives GPT-like models the ability to "remember" facts across conversations.  
For example:
- User: "I use Shram and Magnet as productivity tools"
- Later in another conversation:
- User: "What are the productivity tools that I use?"
- Answer: "You use Shram and Magnet"
